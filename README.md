# slatebot

Slatebot is a discord bot template, aiming to provide a "clean slate" in which you can build your own discord bot. 

Written in Python using Discord.py API. 

Current version is a bare-bones bot, that connects to discord and displays a presence. Future build will also include basic command. For now, you'll need to add your own for the bot to do anything functional. 

Release V.0.9.0 available -- after download, dont forget to add a .env file containing your discord bot token to the folder. 

Requires the following python modules:

discord

pythnon-dotenv
